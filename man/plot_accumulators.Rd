}
\arguments{
\item{model}{A race model (`race_spec`, finalized model structure, or `model_tables`).}

\item{xlim}{Optional x-axis limits. If `NULL`, computed from onsets and line length.}

\item{ylim}{Y-axis limits.}

\item{line_length}{Trajectory length in plot units.}

\item{angle_dodge}{Target angular spacing in degrees between neighbouring accumulators.
Angles are centered at 45 degrees and constrained to the interval [10, 80].
If there are too many accumulators sharing the same onset, spacing is reduced
uniformly within that onset group.}

\item{accumulator_order}{Optional character vector of accumulator labels, ordered
from top-to-bottom. This only affects accumulators sharing the same onset.}

\item{curve_strength}{Curvature multiplier for relationship arcs.}

\item{line_col}{Color for accumulator trajectories.}

\item{line_lwd}{Line width for accumulator trajectories.}

\item{axis_lwd}{Line width for x/y axis arrows.}

\item{link_lwd}{Reserved for reciprocal relationship arrows (currently disabled).}

\item{blocker_lwd}{Line width for blocker arrows.}

\item{show_labels}{If `TRUE`, draw accumulator labels near trajectory endpoints.}

\item{main}{Main title.}

\item{xlab}{X-axis label.}

\item{ylab}{Y-axis label.}

\item{...}{Additional arguments passed to `graphics::plot`.}
}
\value{
Invisibly returns a list with plotting coordinates and inferred links.
}
\description{
Draws a model-wide accumulator schematic with time on the x-axis and evidence
on the y-axis. Each accumulator is drawn as an onset-aware diagonal trajectory.
Blocker links from guard relationships are overlaid as red dotted curves.
